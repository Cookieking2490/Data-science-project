All the usual stuff about experience, qualifications, debating style, even sincerity - quite irrelevant in this election. It's nearly unbelievable that there should be any questions at this point. Harris is a normal, non-toxic human being.  Her opponent is not.  He has promised to end the American system.  Those are the choices.",421,

6,sol_air_dude,"I'm an independent who believes balance is essential in order to maintain a happy and peaceful life. This is apparent in almost everything throughout the universe. For every action there's an equal and opposite reaction, yin and yang, dark and light, life and death, etc. 

I was not a Trump supporter in any way before he ran for President, when he ran or when he won. I personally wanted Bernie Sanders to win because I believed he truly had the average Americans best interest at heart and would be willing to work with politicians to make this happen, realizing that compromises are sometimes the best way to a resolution. Instead we got Trump.

I always thought his accomplishments as a businessman were over exaggerated, his failures ignored. The way he was on Twitter 24 hours a day posting the most immature and ridiculous things along with his views on foreign policy, domestic policy and national security, I fucking hated it. The way he made his fathers ""small loan"" of, anywhere from 1-60 million dollars (can't find the actual figure anywhere)  seem insignifican to his success bothered the hell out of me. All of these things made me view Trump as President in a very negative way. 

Then this current administration took over. Things went from being pretty good overall, besides Covid, to ok, to bad, to now. Eggs went up to almost $10 in places. The border is out of control, a Venezuelan gang is spreading and taking over parts of the country like a cancer and the administration and their media lackeys are serving disinformation by the handful. Joe Biden aged drastically and suffered the early stages of dementia; and somehow Kamala Harris was exempt from the election process to become the Democratic nominee when Robert Kennedy had spent the last year advocating, campaigning, getting over a million signatures for him to meet these requirements to possibly get nominated and just when he had the chance, his own party sabotaged him and provided the gift that never stops giving (to illegal immigrants) Kamala Harris. 

I didn't know much about her at first. So I did a lot of research, wondering why isn't she willing to do any interviews. That's odd. 

Then I figured out why. She's not who she's pretending to be. She's disingenuous, power hungry, tyrannical, unqualified and dishonest. Her record as a DA is presented as a massive success on her website and by the biased media, but nobody outside of certain venues talk about the wrongful charges and imprisonment against innocent people, withholding evidence to overturn and free an innocent man from death row, putting a single mother in jail for a year because her daughter was hospitalized due to sickle cell anemia. Her ""humble "" beginnings, her delusions of granduer and her wharped views of racial segregation she never experienced the way she portrays. She isn't black. Not even a little bit. The way she is always pandering to whatever group of people she is around, her multiple accents when around white, black and Hispanic people....her lack of commitment to any policy while campaigning besides ""Trumps a danger to democracy"" while at the same time wanting to regulate speech because it's a hindrance to implementing certain things, mitt Romney and Hilary believe the same...her lack of compassion during Hurricane Helene, her wanting to get into the spotlight during hurricane Milton...her overall tone when speaking, her cackle, her mocking and insulting peoples faiths...her saying she knows about parenting because she became a step mom to two already grown adult ""step chidren"" (j think one was a senior or junior in high school, the other an adult)....all these obviously bought (possibly black mailed) celebrity endorsements as well as being endorsed by celebrities who are directly tied to P Diddy as his closest friends in his close circle who attended his ""Freak offs""  the same 9 Diddy who is being charged with SA and trafficking of minors and was an evil version of Bill Cosby (says alot)

Don' t fall for the Dems scare tactics and the other side is as stern in its unbridled support of Israel.

Don't think this has no impact on the U.S., it always has and with the 2 party system it always will.

Even if you think it willhave no direct impact - think how our privacy rights have been trampled inthe last 3 decades.

This? ... I'm sorry you are so afraid. Fear is the mind killer.

My gut says, best to not reply.

I'll just say, I've done a lot of research over the past decade or so, a lot of reading since the housing crash, 2009 for politics related to banking. Many subjects years earlier than that. The history of garbage, the American healthcare system, etc... to name a few. The so called overlords doing the oppression of freedom are international corporations and billionaires who run them, and the law we need to get rid of most is Citizen United. Follow the money. Ask the dead. Who has done what for whom?

The US government? They are human like the rest of us. The country is suffering a lot. I agree. There is almost no middle class anymore. The space people have to live in per capita is smaller and costs 2 to 4 time as much as it did a decade ago. I hear people asking, ""where are all the artists? where are the writers?"" That silence speaks as the only answer. Actors in our hit movies and TV shows increasingly hired from Canada, the UK and Australia, because American actors can't compete while holding down a day job. Jobs both high and low, disappearing to Ai.

What has government done for me lately? My family's insurance premium has been cut by 3/4 from what it was at it's height, in 2020. We got a $725 back owed Amazon credit because of a banking anti-discrimination law passed by Democrats. Those are the first two major things that come to mind.

I think I'll stop now. But, I'll just add one more thing. I'm betting against a civil war for one reason. Women.

Also, the American government sent a letter to Venezuelan voters about the results of their recent election, saying that they were actually wrong and was a glitch in the voting machines. Apparently, the person who ""won"" did so in the most unexpected come from behind way possible.

And one thoughtful person wanted to look at the bar graph of the so called glitch and overall election results. Guess what?

They're exactly identical to the voting results in Georgia....where Biden came from way behind and won. 

Look, I'm not a Trumo supporter. I definitely think he's the much better option that Kamala Harris, who literally fucked her way into the white house. Either by actually rucking people, or fuckjng people over.

Kamala Harris being a lawyer and being highly educated doesn't mean she's highly intelligent.

‚ÄúPolitical pragmatism‚Äù refers to a kind of willingness to do whatever works to reach the desired goal, but it does not, it cannot, say what that goal will be.

138,jmd709,"Moderate is relative based on the position someone is looking at it. To someone with conservative or far right views, he doesn‚Äôt appear moderate, he is a leftist. To those that hold more progressive or far left views, he is too moderate/not progressive enough. He is close enough to center to either appeal to a wide range of people or the opposite by only appealing to a small group by not really appealing to progressives or conservatives. The center is where the majority are though instead of far left or far right. 

Anyone that considers themselves as moderate or left leaning can‚Äôt realistically vote for someone far-right like most of the GOP nominees presented themselves as. Some that consider themselves moderate and right leaning will have a hard time choosing far right over a choice that is closer to center even if it‚Äôs somewhat left of center. I was hoping for a true GOP nominee this year instead of candidates the either lean hard right or based the entire campaign on trying to pull back the curtain for voters to see who #45 is simply because that particular candidate finally saw what was behind the curtain after being a supporter for however long.  

If it‚Äôs based on policy, there is one very clear candidate to vote for in 2024 because of what he has accomplished since taking office in 2021 and even the things he attempted to accomplish that were either blocked by Congress or federal judges. 

He has proven that his priority is others instead of himself. The front runner of the GOP continues to show he is his #1 priority and he will look out for himself without any regard for the damages that has or will cause for anyone else. It‚Äôs hard to believe he is prioritizing America considering he knew he was facing criminal indictments that hadn‚Äôt been announced yet but chose to run instead of stepping aside to let other candidates have a chance at becoming the nominee without all the excess baggage.

I give trust until I have been given a reason not to. I don‚Äôt consider being a politician as an automatic reason not to give trust. Trump makes it impossible to say, ‚Äúevery politician lies‚Äù as if all politicians are on the same level with the quantity and types of lies. You didn‚Äôt say that but I included it as an example because of the thing about not trusting anyone and the part about they all stick together.

I also started using comedians, specifically night time show host monologues, as my go to sources to hear about current events instead of reading about current events on news sites. I‚Äôm perfectly fine with admitting I prefer bad news to be delivered with a punchline. Sometimes that can get to be too much depending on what‚Äôs going on so I take a break. I live in an area that is considered deep red. I can‚Äôt completely avoid politics sometimes.

Would it have been great for the liberal justices to rule in favor of Colorado keeping him off the ballot? 

The answer is yes & no. 

It would have seemed correct to a lot of people but the reality is that it would have been based on partisan politics, which is not the assignment of justifies on the Supreme Court. Some justices seem to be confused about their actual assignment but that doesn‚Äôt make it okay for other justices to base their rulings on personal partisan politics.

That cannot become the norm for all the justices just because a few don‚Äôt take their oaths seriously. 

Had the appeal to SCOTUS been after a court found Trump guilty of inciting an insurrection and the appeal had been to determine if the ruling was correct/appropriate, that would have been a completely different case. 

Honest justices could not base the ruling on whether or not he incited an insurrection because that wasn‚Äôt what the appeal was about. 

Trae Crowder, The Liberal Redneck has a good synopsis and his own opinion about it on YouTube. 

Some people benefit by presenting it as if the ruling was actually about whether or not he incited an insurrection but those people are opportunistic jack holes that are attempting to misrepresent it for their own benefit.

152,Uva_Be,"The short answer - I typed linking, I meant liking, yes it‚Äôs a typo.   
  
The long answer ‚Äì Linking versus liking. I linked POTUS and VP teams for 2024. True, but I actually meant to type liking. I could blame autocorrect. But, I think it was me. I can't read/edit what I write. I've never been able to do this. I'm also terrible at homophones, (words that sound like other words) and will often choose a wrong word based on the word I like the sound of better, in this case lie king versus linking, or le inking. It‚Äôs a Freudian slip, also called parapraxis, is an error in speech, memory, or physical action that occurs due to the interference of an unconscious subdued wish or internal train of thought.  
  
I copy and paste web links all day when I‚Äôm on the internet and I‚Äôve been playing too much Zelda ZTOK, therefore Link‚Äôs on my mind. And Le inking it‚Äôs still #inktober. The ink is also, again on my mind.   
  
Contrast that with li king, I've been VERY anti kings and lies lately. Not, because of any real Kings in the world that I'm totally ignoring. But, because of the concept of kings and ""king-making"" both in fiction and in the actual wealth gap, I‚Äôm mentality weary of the wealthy ruling over and destroying for profit ""everything"" a.k.a. the planet we all share air and water on.  
  
All this typing to say, yes, this IS an error, meant liking, typed linking, posted it via copy & paste of a link on 6 social media platforms and didn't even notice the error until the next morning with coffee. That was Sunday. I don't like to pay attention to social media on the weekends because my BFF works 5/10+ hour days remote and I'd rather pay attention to the world I'm in and ignore the world via screens as much as is physically possible on weekends and I already ‚Äúwasted/spent‚Äù half a day on Saturday on the social media.",1846,

And the history of hate and lies the lame-stream-media has built up against Hillary over the decades is too much for any regular TV news or Facebook user to easily overcome. I really had to work to research enough about her to decided I liked her before I voted for her in the 2016 election. No, I didn't vote for her in the primaries, ever. 

Okay, enough of me talking. I really, really want to hear from some young people, younger than this middle aged Gen-Xer.

235,Uva_Be,"On a very serious level I agree, there are no real independent voters -- because there are no independent candidates to vote for. 

The closest we got to being about to vote for an independent socialist was Bernie Sanders.

Still it is a real trend since 2004 the Independent leaning is the majority in the US, have you read the Gallop polls? 

I agree, the Do-Nothing-Democrats and the Obstructionist-Republicans it really is no choice at all.

242,SunnyNowAndThen,"Read newspapers your local paper, NY Times, Houston Chronicle, Washington Post, Miami Herald, LA Times, Chicago Tribune, watch news on TV - but not news networks - watch ABC, CBS, NBC.  With newspapers they can be sued for publishing lies and that is why they are the most trustworthy most of the time.  SAme goes for broadcast news on ABC, CBS and NBC. If you see a story in all of them you can be safe believing it true.  For Biden his deeds qualify him as far as I am concerned which you can see on social media in his posts.  The prez can't claim to do a thing and lie without the world coming down on him/her.  For trump the Jan 6 committee report is online for all to read with under oath testimony and it is eye opening.  

Above all avoid OTHER PEOPLE'S opinions on issues and candidates.  Joe Rogan  and George Conway are entertaining commentators but their opinion is no more valuable than another persons or as trustworthy.  The best way to judge is by what the candidate has accomplished, failed to accomplish, promised or will promise to do.  If you have a friend who is for Biden ask them to tell you why.  If they are for Trump, ask the same.  If they can't give you truthful reasons that don't involve prejudices or lies then decided for yourself if you value that opinion.

Look at the Dems and GOP two candidates before you consider a third party.  Why?  Because a third party, unless they can certainly win, could skew the election for the candidate you DON'T want.

And it's not limited to just politics. It's also crime, racism, anti-women, etc... The goal is corporate profit, just in case you wondered.

However Dems are now favored to add senate seats, so the Maga clowns and traitors would take over the House and waste time running a lot of bogus investigations and defunding Ukraine for their master Putin while the senate would block anything they do, as would Biden.

Attention then turns to the states.  The conventional wisdom is that Desantis and Abbott are somehow unbeatable, but in fact they are both very beatable and victims of the same 45-45 50-50 situation.  Neither TX nor FL is really a red state, FL definitely purple and TX almost purple.   Therefore those two governors races are up for grabs by democrats if they can harness the momo and get turnout to record highs. If so, then dems and Carlie Crist could knock off desantis before he even has a chance to run for president.

In both TX and FL, Desantis and Abbott have less than 50% support, around 47-48%. But they also have more than 47-48% who disapprove of them and around 45% who strongly disapprove of them.   So any wave of good vibes by Beto and Crist can do the trick. Desantis is now stuck and unwilling to ban abortion as he promised the religious right, l but everyone will know he's going to do it if he wins.  Polls show that 10% of voters plan to vote with abortion as their #1 issue, and those are all pro choice voters.  That right there could make the difference.

LIberty or freedom is the last thing the rightwing wants, or is willing to give. Look at Putin in Russia, their role model now. Who has liberty there?  No one.

Women they believe are meant to be seen not heard and are property of the men, including girls as young as 12.

* **1973:** The US Department of Justice ‚Äî under the Nixon administration, out of all administrations ‚Äî sued the Trump Management Corporation for violating the Fair Housing Act. Federal officials found evidence that Trump had refused to rent to Black tenants and lied to Black applicants about whether apartments were available, among other accusations. Trump said the federal government was trying to get him to rent to welfare recipients. In the aftermath, he signed an agreement in 1975 agreeing not to discriminate to renters of color without admitting to previous discrimination.
* **1980s:** Kip Brown, a former employee at Trump‚Äôs Castle, accused another one of Trump‚Äôs businesses of discrimination. ‚ÄúWhen Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor,‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúIt was the eighties, I was a teenager, but I remember it: They put us all in the back.‚Äù
* **1989:** In a controversial case that‚Äôs been characterized as a modern-day lynching, four Black teenagers and one Latino teenager ‚Äî the ‚ÄúCentral Park Five‚Äù ‚Äî were accused of attacking and raping a jogger in New York City. Trump immediately took charge in the case, running an ad in local papers demanding, ‚ÄúBRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY. BRING BACK OUR POLICE!‚Äù The teens‚Äô convictions were later vacated after they spent seven to 13 years in prison, and the city paid $41 million in a settlement to the teens. But Trump in October 2016 said he still believes they‚Äôre guilty, despite the DNA evidence to the contrary.
* **1991:** A book by John O‚ÄôDonnell, former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, quoted Trump‚Äôs criticism of a Black accountant: ‚ÄúBlack guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. ‚Ä¶ I think that the guy is lazy. And it‚Äôs probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It‚Äôs not anything they can control.‚Äù Trump later said in a 1997 Playboy interview that ‚Äúthe stuff O‚ÄôDonnell wrote about me is probably true.‚Äù
* **1992:** The Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino had to pay a $200,000 fine because it transferred Black and women dealers off tables to accommodate a big-time gambler‚Äôs prejudices.
* **1993:** In congressional testimony, Trump said that some Native American reservations operating casinos shouldn‚Äôt be allowed because ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt look like Indians to me.‚Äù
* **2000:** In opposition to a casino proposed by the St. Regis Mohawk tribe, which he saw as a financial threat to his casinos in Atlantic City, Trump secretly ran a series of ads suggesting the tribe had a ‚Äúrecord of criminal activity \[that\] is well documented.‚Äù
* **2004:** In season two of *The Apprentice*, Trump fired Kevin Allen, a Black contestant, for being overeducated. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an unbelievably talented guy in terms of education, and you haven‚Äôt done anything,‚Äù Trump said on the show. ‚ÄúAt some point you have to say, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs enough.‚Äô‚Äù
* **2005:** Trump publicly pitched what was essentially *The Apprentice: White People vs. Black People*. He said he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt particularly happy‚Äù with the most recent season of his show, so he was considering ‚Äúan idea that is fairly controversial ‚Äî creating a team of successful African Americans versus a team of successful whites. Whether people like that idea or not, it is somewhat reflective of our very vicious world.‚Äù
* **2010:** In 2010, there was a huge national controversy over the ‚ÄúGround Zero Mosque‚Äù ‚Äî a proposal to build a Muslim community center in Lower Manhattan, near the site of the 9/11 attacks. Trump opposed the project, calling it ‚Äúinsensitive,‚Äù and offered to buy out one of the investors in the project. On *The Late Show With David Letterman*, Trump argued, referring to Muslims, ‚ÄúWell, somebody‚Äôs blowing us up. Somebody‚Äôs blowing up buildings, and somebody‚Äôs doing lots of bad stuff.‚Äù
* **2011:** Trump played a big role in pushing false rumors that Obama ‚Äî the country‚Äôs first Black president ‚Äî was not born in the US. He claimed to send investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama‚Äôs birth certificate. Obama later released his birth certificate, calling Trump a ‚Äúcarnival barker.‚Äù The research has found a strong correlation between birtherism, as the conspiracy theory is called, and racism. But Trump has reportedly continued pushing this conspiracy theory in private.
* **2011:** While Trump suggested that Obama wasn‚Äôt born in the US, he also argued that maybe Obama wasn‚Äôt a good enough student to have gotten into Columbia or Harvard Law School, and demanded Obama release his university transcripts.

Hillary is as Trump told Stormy Daniels ""the most brilliant person on earth"" and we all respect her, but even though Putin deviously sabotaged her campaign in 2016, just the fact she could let herself lose after starting with a 20% lead means she is a 2nd rate candidate with first class credentials.   

I have predicted every Dem nomination since Jimmy Carter.   It is too early to know who is running in 2024, but assuming Biden has never intended to run again, let's take him off the list.   The three strongest candidates then become Gavin Newsom, Kamala Harris (both from California) and then a third, and this third I am personally lobbying  to run, see my Matthew McConaughey for President subreddit.   Matthew might be motivated now to become the democratic reagan, and if so, he would win Texas, so end of story, but he could indeed win by 45 states, a complete blowout. Desantis wouldn't stand a chance against him.  If Matthew doesn't run, or some other very charismatic candidate doesnt emerge, I am for Gavin Newsom.  He will have to tack to the center, but he has it all otherwise.",1102,

319,Immediate-Assist-598,"Spoken like a true RNC spin doctor.  The GOP is terrified of all three of them. especially Matthew.   So please spare us the false assumptions and kneejerk hatred and stupid insults aimed at anyone who isn't a Maga neo fascist republican.   The country cannot afford Trump or Desantis as that would be the end of democracy and what makes America truly great. Also, Putin is behind botrh of them and in case you hadn't heard, Putin is our enemy and we are basically at war with him now, a very just war on our part I might add, and a mandatory one.   The question is what comes next?  Gavin Newsom might be great but if it is close race and Trump-Desantis uses the election fraud tricks they have already set into place, well not very good for our country, right?  and Kamala Harris might rise to the occasion and catch fire. Biden might even run again in much strronger shape than he is now, but I a, looking for another answer to save the USA.

Matthew McConaughey almost ran for Texas governor.  That proves the baseline, that he is considering running for very high office.  If Beto hadn't been there, much better prepared, Matthew might have gone for it. He would have won by a landslide too. Or maybe Matthew just didn't quite think it was worth giving up his wonderful career, family and charity life.   But president if the country really needs him?  

Matthew returned to his super fun family, show biz and charity life, but then Uvalde happened. His hometown. That changed his life.  That struck him very deeply.  He hired a political lobbying firm and next thing he was at the White House podium,  meeting with Biden, top senators of both parties and making his presence known. You can also see the experience deeply moved him and no doubt he knows that if he wanted the presidency and devoted himself, he could win it.  

Matthew has been underestimated all his life.   There is something about him that transcends all the usual partisan BS. He is a combination of liberal and conservative.  No one owns him.  And anyone who says an actor can't be a great president remember Zelensky was nothing but an actor before he became the greatest president in the world.  Not to mention Reagan, Al Franken, Arnold and others who have excelled.  So people complain about career politicians and gridlock, well Matthew is the answer.

Many also feel Ronald Reagan was the greatest leader of the last generation.   Arnold S also turned out to be a fine leader.   So I am not worried about Matthew at all.  If he decides to run, he will educate himself quickly and make wise decisions.

As for Trump, he is a professional con man and crooked businessman fed by his father and then Putin's money.  Trump doesn't even read or write.  He is an ignoramus. He doesn't give a damn about anyone but himself and Putin. He didn't even know Finland was a country.  He didn't even listen to his intel reports. He was incapable of discussing a single issue in any rational detail.  All he cared about was what was in it for himself.  He is a criminal in all ways, and now a proven Russian-backed traitor.  He has taken huge bribes from Russia, China, Saudis, the NRA, Big Oil etc etc., so they own him. 

Also, while Trump did play a fictional billionaire in The Apprentice, he cannot be called an actor. That is an insult to the craft and art of acting.

I am 65 in my early days women were not expected to be more than housewives or secretaries. The 70's were the turning point, but it took another 35 years for Hillary to be a nominee.  And thanks to Putin mostly she lost.    So now we have set the clock back 10 years, and Metoo did not help. Metoo was very excessive. Branding horny men as criminals when half the women want men to be horny and sometimes pushy, was counter-productive. Only a few of them deserved jail time.

I despise Trump, but remember even with Putin's help he got elected as an real sex criminal versus women and underaged girls. Even his own daughter when she was 12.What that tells me is that 50% of our country doesnt care about women.  Even half of Republican women do not care.  They want to be objects not equals.  Also remember that many in the feminist movement especially Metoo are lesbians. That is an inconvenient fact. They do not want mens competition. But that is a very minority view and cannot succeed.

Abprtion is different though, and esp contraceptives and truthful sex ed. Those are issues that hit home with everyone, and on those issues dems has a 65-35% advantage.

So I recommend to my democratic colleagues from left to center right that TO WIN WHICH IS EVERYTHING we all unite from left to center right behind whomever the dems nominate, but the best chance of success in 2024 is Matthew McConaughey (70% would vote for him) if he does us the favor of running, or else Gavin Newsom.

What we honestly need is a complete overhaul. By people with the publics interest at heart. Not money or their own. No one likes taxes because our government burns trillions like no tomorrow.

I think Newsom is weaker than most think. He comes off as the definition of slimy coastal elite. Whitmer might honestly be a better candidate.

As for DeSantis, my top picks for VP are Kim Reynolds, Mike Garcia, Tim Scott, and Glenn Youngkin. Not sure which is best but at the moment I‚Äôm leaning Reynolds since she‚Äôs a popular governor of a midwestern state and offers a calm demeanor to help balance out DeSantis.

The liberal wing of the Dems might scream, but these moderate Dems would have national appeal, possibly very strong with Independents, most of whom lean Republican. Carrying North Carolina and Michigan would go a long way toward winning 270 electoral votes.

Republicans, on the other hand, practically have to choose DeSantis to beat Trump in the primaries. Who he would add to his ticket might also reflect electoral strategy - probably would want someone from AZ or PA or WI or NV - or the Governor of GA if he could convince him.",672,

Harris is a ghost. Only a few sometime odd bits of her speeches make it through the orange haze that coats the news media like the hood over a fryer stove. Not that W Bushes father was much of a talker either. Trickle down went so well, ... ask if you aren't old enough or have read enough history to know what trickle down economics was about. 

Thanks very much for trying. Personally, I wouldn't mind POTUS Harris at all. Much, much more intelligent and younger than both of those old white guys in the lead er, by various metrics, Biden only seems to be in the lead via fund raising, not by the polls.

He is working this so called assault as an election tool and Republicans are all over it and you‚Äôre not checking Project 2025 are you?  IT WORKED! A day before their convention opens? I think it was broken glass not a bullet that hit him. The injury looks like a very bad cut. It is sad for the injured and dead who went to watch the orange anti-christ wannabe orange Jesus turd. There is just too many coincidences and inconsistencies that make me wonder but as much as I wish I could give Trump the benefit of the doubt?  Also the screens were the first time done at a rally, the shooter was seen and police did nothing, unfortunately the shooter was killed so no ability to question the YOUNG 20 YEAR OLD REGISTERED REPUBLICAN. ITS NOT PASSING THE SMELL TEST BUT I DO HOPE I AM WRONG. I HOPE THAT I AM WRONG BUT IT WAS STAGED TO GET ELECTION VOTE SYMPATHY FOR THE REALITY SHOW ACTOR.  The question is does it matter enough to let TRUMP and possibly a facist like JD VANCE TO WIN?  That is the Republican Party‚Äôs desired interest. This doesn‚Äôt mean I want Trump dead but rather it is just a bit too smelly to trust a man who has built his reputation on deception, toxic ideologies , fraud, theft, bullying, grifting, destruction and deceit, evil and I can‚Äôt bring myself to keep going as my finger would cramp describing a desperate 78 year old felon who is clearly clawing his way to win to stay out of jail. He will go down in history with his followers as the most evil Americans in history. God bless those killed and injured but in a he eyes of those evil Trump soldiers the loss was a necessary evil in a war between Evil Trump and God and Democracy. I wish they had not gone to see him as they would still be alive and well. Personally I don‚Äôt think it was the first attempt as he was sent white powder and at a rally a viewer pulled a gun unsuccessfully to shoot him (look it up in the internet) nor will it be the last attempt. If anything it will have put out there ideas which next time may succeed which will be an unfortunate use of violence. Thank god the shooter did not have a gun with a bump stock like those approved by the fascists on SCOTUS.",2282,
