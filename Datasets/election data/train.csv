This? ... I'm sorry you are so afraid. Fear is the mind killer.

My gut says, best to not reply.

I'll just say, I've done a lot of research over the past decade or so, a lot of reading since the housing crash, 2009 for politics related to banking. Many subjects years earlier than that. The history of garbage, the American healthcare system, etc... to name a few. The so called overlords doing the oppression of freedom are international corporations and billionaires who run them, and the law we need to get rid of most is Citizen United. Follow the money. Ask the dead. Who has done what for whom?

The US government? They are human like the rest of us. The country is suffering a lot. I agree. There is almost no middle class anymore. The space people have to live in per capita is smaller and costs 2 to 4 time as much as it did a decade ago. I hear people asking, ""where are all the artists? where are the writers?"" That silence speaks as the only answer. Actors in our hit movies and TV shows increasingly hired from Canada, the UK and Australia, because American actors can't compete while holding down a day job. Jobs both high and low, disappearing to Ai.

What has government done for me lately? My family's insurance premium has been cut by 3/4 from what it was at it's height, in 2020. We got a $725 back owed Amazon credit because of a banking anti-discrimination law passed by Democrats. Those are the first two major things that come to mind.

I think I'll stop now. But, I'll just add one more thing. I'm betting against a civil war for one reason. Women. Women voters, grandmas to all the teenagers who get to vote for the first time this election. If you love women, then don't vote for hate or out of fear.

I give trust until I have been given a reason not to. I don’t consider being a politician as an automatic reason not to give trust. Trump makes it impossible to say, “every politician lies” as if all politicians are on the same level with the quantity and types of lies. You didn’t say that but I included it as an example because of the thing about not trusting anyone and the part about they all stick together. Some stick together with a blind devotion (or at least act like it’s a blind devotion but it’s really about doing whatever benefits themselves the most), and sometimes it’s necessary in order to get something pushed through because it’s better than the alternative of getting nothing pushed through. 

I was getting angry and frustrated about politics for a while & I realized that for me the main source of that was FB. I joined Reddit and started using it as my go-to for feed scrolling that I would have been doing on FB. Reddit has the perk of being able to choose the type of topics you want on your feed. Sometimes I just need really like stuff like videos of animals and old people being silly or cute, most of the time I’m fine with having a wide range of topics on my feed. 

I also started using comedians, specifically night time show host monologues, as my go to sources to hear about current events instead of reading about current events on news sites. I’m perfectly fine with admitting I prefer bad news to be delivered with a punchline. Sometimes that can get to be too much depending on what’s going on so I take a break. I live in an area that is considered deep red. I can’t completely avoid politics sometimes. Hearing an elderly guy rant conspiracy theories as if those are actually facts at the local Dollar General while I’m just trying to checkout and leave makes it hard to ignore the reality that things aren’t going well in terms of ummmmm a decline to “WTF, some people are actually that F-ing dumb and gullible?!?!” I’ve learned to just repeat a mantra in my head, “some people are alive because breathing is involuntary-it doesn’t require thinking” or just “breathing is an involuntary action” over and over because Idt some people would still be alive if they actually had to think in order to breathe. 

Things aren’t great right now but it’s definitely better than it was 4-7 years ago and better than how bad things could potentially get if the oversized OompaLoompa gets back into office.

He has been charged but the case has not been tried yet. No matter what our own eyes and everyone else’s eyes saw on Jan 6th, he has not been declared guilty of inciting an insurrection by a court of law. 

Would it have been great for the liberal justices to rule in favor of Colorado keeping him off the ballot? 

The answer is yes & no. 

It would have seemed correct to a lot of people but the reality is that it would have been based on partisan politics, which is not the assignment of justifies on the Supreme Court. Some justices seem to be confused about their actual assignment but that doesn’t make it okay for other justices to base their rulings on personal partisan politics. Those justices need to remain the outliers of justices that go against their oaths by allowing outside influences to buy or coerce them to rule a certain way. That cannot become the norm for all the justices just because a few don’t take their oaths seriously. 

Had the appeal to SCOTUS been after a court found Trump guilty of inciting an insurrection and the appeal had been to determine if the ruling was correct/appropriate, that would have been a completely different case. 

Honest justices could not base the ruling on whether or not he incited an insurrection because that wasn’t what the appeal was about. 

Trae Crowder, The Liberal Redneck has a good synopsis and his own opinion about it on YouTube. 

Some people benefit by presenting it as if the ruling was actually about whether or not he incited an insurrection but those people are opportunistic jack holes that are attempting to misrepresent it for their own benefit.

Neither side has any advantage except the gerrymandered districts by then GOP. if they win the House they will likely lose the vote, so very undemocratic. However Dems are now favored to add senate seats, so the Maga clowns and traitors would take over the House and waste time running a lot of bogus investigations and defunding Ukraine for their master Putin while the senate would block anything they do, as would Biden.

Attention then turns to the states.  The conventional wisdom is that Desantis and Abbott are somehow unbeatable, but in fact they are both very beatable and victims of the same 45-45 50-50 situation.  Neither TX nor FL is really a red state, FL definitely purple and TX almost purple.   Therefore those two governors races are up for grabs by democrats if they can harness the momo and get turnout to record highs. If so, then dems and Carlie Crist could knock off desantis before he even has a chance to run for president.

In both TX and FL, Desantis and Abbott have less than 50% support, around 47-48%. But they also have more than 47-48% who disapprove of them and around 45% who strongly disapprove of them.   So any wave of good vibes by Beto and Crist can do the trick. Desantis is now stuck and unwilling to ban abortion as he promised the religious right, l but everyone will know he's going to do it if he wins.  Polls show that 10% of voters plan to vote with abortion as their #1 issue, and those are all pro choice voters.  That right there could make the difference.

As for Trump, he is a professional con man and crooked businessman fed by his father and then Putin's money.  Trump doesn't even read or write.  He is an ignoramus.

Matthew McConaughey almost ran for Texas governor.  That proves the baseline, that he is considering running for very high office.

Matthew returned to his super fun family, show biz and charity life, but then Uvalde happened. His hometown. That changed his life.  That struck him very deeply.  He hired a political lobbying firm and next thing he was at the White House podium,  meeting with Biden, top senators of both parties and making his presence known. You can also see the experience deeply moved him and no doubt he knows that if he wanted the presidency and devoted himself, he could win it.  

Matthew has been underestimated all his life.   There is something about him that transcends all the usual partisan BS. He is a combination of liberal and conservative.  No one owns him.  And anyone who says an actor can't be a great president remember Zelensky was nothing but an actor before he became the greatest president in the world.

Also, the American government sent a letter to Venezuelan voters about the results of their recent election, saying that they were actually wrong and was a glitch in the voting machines. Apparently, the person who ""won"" did so in the most unexpected come from behind way possible.

And one thoughtful person wanted to look at the bar graph of the so called glitch and overall election results. Guess what?

They're exactly identical to the voting results in Georgia....where Biden came from way behind and won. 

Look, I'm not a Trumo supporter. I definitely think he's the much better option that Kamala Harris, who literally fucked her way into the white house. Either by actually rucking people, or fuckjng people over.

And im not sure why you're telling me all the Republicans who supported Kamala? That proves one thing to me, as does all the celebrities endorsing Kamala (whom she paid a lot of money)  these people are part or the Status Quo that has kept America In a perpetual and unwinnable war against terrorism, which is really just an excuse for globalization.

Going through law school doesn't make you a God that makes no mistakes, and having parental support makes a huge difference, no question, but it does show that you have worked your ass off, not just watching tv and believing haitians eat pets and even go on adamantly claiming that in front of millions of people without a second thought.

With newspapers they can be sued for publishing lies and that is why they are the most trustworthy most of the time.  SAme goes for broadcast news on ABC, CBS and NBC. If you see a story in all of them you can be safe believing it true.  For Biden his deeds qualify him as far as I am concerned which you can see on social media in his posts.  The prez can't claim to do a thing and lie without the world coming down on him/her.  For trump the Jan 6 committee report is online for all to read with under oath testimony and it is eye opening.  

Above all avoid OTHER PEOPLE'S opinions on issues and candidates.  Joe Rogan  and George Conway are entertaining commentators but their opinion is no more valuable than another persons or as trustworthy.  The best way to judge is by what the candidate has accomplished, failed to accomplish, promised or will promise to do.  If you have a friend who is for Biden ask them to tell you why.  If they are for Trump, ask the same.  If they can't give you truthful reasons that don't involve prejudices or lies then decided for yourself if you value that opinion.

The long answer – Linking versus liking. I linked POTUS and VP teams for 2024. True, but I actually meant to type liking. I could blame autocorrect. But, I think it was me. I can't read/edit what I write. I've never been able to do this. I'm also terrible at homophones, (words that sound like other words) and will often choose a wrong word based on the word I like the sound of better, in this case lie king versus linking, or le inking. It’s a Freudian slip, also called parapraxis, is an error in speech, memory, or physical action that occurs due to the interference of an unconscious subdued wish or internal train of thought.  
  
I copy and paste web links all day when I’m on the internet and I’ve been playing too much Zelda ZTOK, therefore Link’s on my mind. And Le inking it’s still #inktober. The ink is also, again on my mind.   
  
Contrast that with li king, I've been VERY anti kings and lies lately. Not, because of any real Kings in the world that I'm totally ignoring. But, because of the concept of kings and ""king-making"" both in fiction and in the actual wealth gap, I’m mentality weary of the wealthy ruling over and destroying for profit ""everything"" a.k.a. the planet we all share air and water on.
