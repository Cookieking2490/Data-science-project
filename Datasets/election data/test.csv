556,Lazy_Gringo3,"LIAR, democracy works unless the far right or other extremists sabotage or steal it.  That is way happened on january 6th and back in 2016 with Putin's interference campaign too. 

Without a fair and free democracy the USA and everything it stands for ceases to exist. Jim Crow was an attempt by the racist far right to sabotage and steal democracy. It was extreme voter suppression aimed at blacks and went on for a very long time before democrats fixed that.

LIberty or freedom is the last thing the rightwing wants, or is willing to give. Look at Putin in Russia, their role model now. Who has liberty there?  No one.  No liberty, no justice, no democracy, you cant even express yourself without risking getting thrown in prison or worse. That is fascism/. Fascism and Nazism are the same thing, totalitarian evil.  Not to mention 100% dishonest and at war with any inconvenient facts.    Also, fascism and Nazism (see Trump, Putin etc) always depends on racism. Attacking the immigrant, the darker race, the poor, the gays, the Jews, college students, the outsiders.    and of course keeping down women, that is always a big part of it.  Women they believe are meant to be seen not heard and are property of the men, including girls as young as 12.  The TN GOP just tried to (and maybe did) pass a law making it legal for old men to marry 14 year old girls.  and removing abortion and contraceptive rights really makes them slaves of the male dominated government.

It appears that’s also how you view the general election with primary elections as the opportunity to show you’d like to have a more progressive candidate.

* **1973:** The US Department of Justice — under the Nixon administration, out of all administrations — sued the Trump Management Corporation for violating the Fair Housing Act. Federal officials found evidence that Trump had refused to rent to Black tenants and lied to Black applicants about whether apartments were available, among other accusations. Trump said the federal government was trying to get him to rent to welfare recipients. In the aftermath, he signed an agreement in 1975 agreeing not to discriminate to renters of color without admitting to previous discrimination.
* **1980s:** Kip Brown, a former employee at Trump’s Castle, accused another one of Trump’s businesses of discrimination. “When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor,” Brown said. “It was the eighties, I was a teenager, but I remember it: They put us all in the back.”
* **1989:** In a controversial case that’s been characterized as a modern-day lynching, four Black teenagers and one Latino teenager — the “Central Park Five” — were accused of attacking and raping a jogger in New York City. Trump immediately took charge in the case, running an ad in local papers demanding, “BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY. BRING BACK OUR POLICE!” The teens’ convictions were later vacated after they spent seven to 13 years in prison, and the city paid $41 million in a settlement to the teens. But Trump in October 2016 said he still believes they’re guilty, despite the DNA evidence to the contrary.
* **1991:** A book by John O’Donnell, former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, quoted Trump’s criticism of a Black accountant: “Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. … I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.” Trump later said in a 1997 Playboy interview that “the stuff O’Donnell wrote about me is probably true.”
* **1992:** The Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino had to pay a $200,000 fine because it transferred Black and women dealers off tables to accommodate a big-time gambler’s prejudices.
* **1993:** In congressional testimony, Trump said that some Native American reservations operating casinos shouldn’t be allowed because “they don’t look like Indians to me.”
* **2000:** In opposition to a casino proposed by the St. Regis Mohawk tribe, which he saw as a financial threat to his casinos in Atlantic City, Trump secretly ran a series of ads suggesting the tribe had a “record of criminal activity \[that\] is well documented.”
* **2004:** In season two of *The Apprentice*, Trump fired Kevin Allen, a Black contestant, for being overeducated. “You’re an unbelievably talented guy in terms of education, and you haven’t done anything,” Trump said on the show. “At some point you have to say, ‘That’s enough.’”
* **2005:** Trump publicly pitched what was essentially *The Apprentice: White People vs. Black People*. He said he “wasn’t particularly happy” with the most recent season of his show, so he was considering “an idea that is fairly controversial — creating a team of successful African Americans versus a team of successful whites. Whether people like that idea or not, it is somewhat reflective of our very vicious world.”
* **2010:** In 2010, there was a huge national controversy over the “Ground Zero Mosque” — a proposal to build a Muslim community center in Lower Manhattan, near the site of the 9/11 attacks. Trump opposed the project, calling it “insensitive,” and offered to buy out one of the investors in the project. On *The Late Show With David Letterman*, Trump argued, referring to Muslims, “Well, somebody’s blowing us up. Somebody’s blowing up buildings, and somebody’s doing lots of bad stuff.”
* **2011:** Trump played a big role in pushing false rumors that Obama — the country’s first Black president — was not born in the US. He claimed to send investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama’s birth certificate. Obama later released his birth certificate, calling Trump a “carnival barker.” The research has found a strong correlation between birtherism, as the conspiracy theory is called, and racism. But Trump has reportedly continued pushing this conspiracy theory in private.
* **2011:** While Trump suggested that Obama wasn’t born in the US, he also argued that maybe Obama wasn’t a good enough student to have gotten into Columbia or Harvard Law School, and demanded Obama release his university transcripts. Trump claimed, “I heard he was a terrible student. Terrible. How does a bad student go to Columbia and then to Harvard?”",-1,4756,15.85913118

I am 65 in my early days women were not expected to be more than housewives or secretaries. The 70's were the turning point, but it took another 35 years for Hillary to be a nominee.  And thanks to Putin mostly she lost.    So now we have set the clock back 10 years, and Metoo did not help. Metoo was very excessive. Branding horny men as criminals when half the women want men to be horny and sometimes pushy, was counter-productive. Only a few of them deserved jail time.

I despise Trump, but remember even with Putin's help he got elected as an real sex criminal versus women and underaged girls. Even his own daughter when she was 12.What that tells me is that 50% of our country doesnt care about women.  Even half of Republican women do not care.  They want to be objects not equals.  Also remember that many in the feminist movement especially Metoo are lesbians. That is an inconvenient fact. They do not want mens competition. But that is a very minority view and cannot succeed.

Abprtion is different though, and esp contraceptives and truthful sex ed. Those are issues that hit home with everyone, and on those issues dems has a 65-35% advantage.

So I recommend to my democratic colleagues from left to center right that TO WIN WHICH IS EVERYTHING we all unite from left to center right behind whomever the dems nominate, but the best chance of success in 2024 is Matthew McConaughey (70% would vote for him) if he does us the favor of running, or else Gavin Newsom. Both super cool dreamboats who are not at all threatened by strong women and fight for womens and civil rights.  Kamala Harris is a distant third to win IMHO, but she might be okay too.

635,jmd709,"Moderate is relative based on the position someone is looking at it. To someone with conservative or far right views, he doesn’t appear moderate, he is a leftist. To those that hold more progressive or far left views, he is too moderate/not progressive enough. He is close enough to center to either appeal to a wide range of people or the opposite by only appealing to a small group by not really appealing to progressives or conservatives. The center is where the majority are though instead of far left or far right. 

Anyone that considers themselves as moderate or left leaning can’t realistically vote for someone far-right like most of the GOP nominees presented themselves as. Some that consider themselves moderate and right leaning will have a hard time choosing far right over a choice that is closer to center even if it’s somewhat left of center. I was hoping for a true GOP nominee this year instead of candidates the either lean hard right or based the entire campaign on trying to pull back the curtain for voters to see who #45 is simply because that particular candidate finally saw what was behind the curtain after being a supporter for however long.  

If it’s based on policy, there is one very clear candidate to vote for in 2024 because of what he has accomplished since taking office in 2021 and even the things he attempted to accomplish that were either blocked by Congress or federal judges. 

He has proven that his priority is others instead of himself. The front runner of the GOP continues to show he is his #1 priority and he will look out for himself without any regard for the damages that has or will cause for anyone else. It’s hard to believe he is prioritizing America considering he knew he was facing criminal indictments that hadn’t been announced yet but chose to run instead of stepping aside to let other candidates have a chance at becoming the nominee without all the excess baggage.

I have voted for the Democratic candidate in the lead and I'm 90% sure I'll be doing so again because we don't have rank choice voting in the US, because of the imbalance between how much a vote is worth in the rural middle of the US versus big city votes and because our electoral college system is working against the American people, failing to do what it was designed to do, i.e. prevent greedy people from using the White House for their own personal profit.

I was not a Trump supporter in any way before he ran for President, when he ran or when he won. I personally wanted Bernie Sanders to win because I believed he truly had the average Americans best interest at heart and would be willing to work with politicians to make this happen, realizing that compromises are sometimes the best way to a resolution. Instead we got Trump.

I always thought his accomplishments as a businessman were over exaggerated, his failures ignored. The way he was on Twitter 24 hours a day posting the most immature and ridiculous things along with his views on foreign policy, domestic policy and national security, I fucking hated it. The way he made his fathers ""small loan"" of, anywhere from 1-60 million dollars (can't find the actual figure anywhere)  seem insignifican to his success bothered the hell out of me. All of these things made me view Trump as President in a very negative way. 

Then this current administration took over. Things went from being pretty good overall, besides Covid, to ok, to bad, to now. Eggs went up to almost $10 in places. The border is out of control, a Venezuelan gang is spreading and taking over parts of the country like a cancer and the administration and their media lackeys are serving disinformation by the handful. Joe Biden aged drastically and suffered the early stages of dementia; and somehow Kamala Harris was exempt from the election process to become the Democratic nominee when Robert Kennedy had spent the last year advocating, campaigning, getting over a million signatures for him to meet these requirements to possibly get nominated and just when he had the chance, his own party sabotaged him and provided the gift that never stops giving (to illegal immigrants) Kamala Harris. 

I didn't know much about her at first. So I did a lot of research, wondering why isn't she willing to do any interviews. That's odd. 

Then I figured out why. She's not who she's pretending to be. She's disingenuous, power hungry, tyrannical, unqualified and dishonest. Her record as a DA is presented as a massive success on her website and by the biased media, but nobody outside of certain venues talk about the wrongful charges and imprisonment against innocent people, withholding evidence to overturn and free an innocent man from death row, putting a single mother in jail for a year because her daughter was hospitalized due to sickle cell anemia. Her ""humble "" beginnings, her delusions of granduer and her wharped views of racial segregation she never experienced the way she portrays. She isn't black. Not even a little bit. The way she is always pandering to whatever group of people she is around, her multiple accents when around white, black and Hispanic people....her lack of commitment to any policy while campaigning besides ""Trumps a danger to democracy"" while at the same time wanting to regulate speech because it's a hindrance to implementing certain things, mitt Romney and Hilary believe the same...her lack of compassion during Hurricane Helene, her wanting to get into the spotlight during hurricane Milton...her overall tone when speaking, her cackle, her mocking and insulting peoples faiths...her saying she knows about parenting because she became a step mom to two already grown adult ""step chidren"" (j think one was a senior or junior in high school, the other an adult)....all these obviously bought (possibly black mailed) celebrity endorsements as well as being endorsed by celebrities who are directly tied to P Diddy as his closest friends in his close circle who attended his ""Freak offs""  the same 9 Diddy who is being charged with SA and trafficking of minors and was an evil version of Bill Cosby (says alot)
